The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `MoodRecord`: This is a dataclass that will represent a mood record. It will have fields for mood, energy, appetite, and sleep.

2. `MoodRecordDB`: This class will handle interactions with the MongoDB database. It will have methods for saving and retrieving mood records.

3. `MoodBot`: This class will handle interactions with the Telegram API. It will have methods for sending messages to the user and handling user responses.

4. `main`: This function will be the entry point for the application. It will create instances of `MoodBot` and `MoodRecordDB` and start the bot.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.

First, we'll start with the `MoodRecord` dataclass. This will be in a file named `mood_record.py`.
